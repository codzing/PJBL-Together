<!-- Certainly! Here are some steps to upgrade your To-Do List app:

1. **Add Task Prioritization**: Allow users to assign different levels of priority to tasks. You can implement this by adding a dropdown menu or radio buttons to select the priority level for each task. Display the priority level next to the task in the list.
2. **Add Task Categories**: Organize tasks into categories (e.g., personal, work, errands). You can implement this by adding a dropdown menu or radio buttons to select the category for each task. Display the category next to the task in the list.
3. **Add Task Deadlines**: Set deadlines for tasks. You can implement this by adding a date picker or input field to enter the deadline for each task. Display the deadline next to the task in the list.
4. **Add Task Completion**: Allow users to mark tasks as completed. You can implement this by adding a checkbox next to each task. Update the task's status in the list and local storage accordingly.
5. **Add Task Search**: Implement a search functionality to quickly find specific tasks in the list. You can add an input field and a search button. Filter the tasks based on the search criteria and display the matching tasks in the list.
6. **Add Task Sorting**: Allow users to sort tasks based on different criteria (e.g., priority, deadline, alphabetically). You can add buttons or dropdown menus to select the sorting criteria. Sort the tasks based on the selected criteria and display the sorted tasks in the list.
7. **Add Task Editing**: Allow users to edit existing tasks and update their details. You can implement this by adding an edit button next to each task. Display an input field or form to edit the task details and update the task in the list and local storage accordingly.
8. **Add Task Deletion**: Implement a confirmation prompt before deleting tasks to prevent accidental deletions. You can add a delete button next to each task. Display a confirmation prompt and delete the task from the list and local storage if the user confirms the deletion.
9. **Add Task Reminders**: Set reminders for upcoming tasks and notify users via email or a notification system. You can use JavaScript's `setTimeout` function or a library like `node-schedule` to schedule reminders for tasks. Display a notification or alert to the user when a task is due.
10. **Add Task Export/Import**: Allow users to export their task list to a file (e.g., JSON, CSV) and import tasks from a file. You can add buttons or dropdown menus to select the export or import option. Use JavaScript's `Blob` object and `FileSaver.js` library to generate and download the export file. Parse and import the tasks from the import file and update the list and local storage accordingly.
11. **Add User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to access and manage their own task lists. You can use a backend framework like Express.js and a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user credentials and task data. Implement login, registration, and session management functionality.
12. **Add Responsive Design**: Make the app responsive and visually appealing on different devices and screen sizes. You can use CSS media queries and responsive design techniques to adjust the layout and styling of the app based on the device's screen size.
13. **Add Error Handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully handle any unexpected errors or exceptions. You can use try-catch blocks and display error messages to the user when an error occurs.
14. **Add Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the app functions correctly and reliably. You can use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to write and run tests for your JavaScript code.
15. **Add Documentation**: Document the app's features, usage, and any known issues or limitations. You can create a README file or a documentation website to provide users with information about the app.

These features will make your To-Do List app more complex and challenging to build. As you work on each feature, make sure to test it thoroughly and handle any potential edge cases or bugs. Good luck! -->
